								<h2>History</h2>
								<p>
									When founder Sara Omohundro realized that no organization for
									women in the investment industry existed in Central Indiana,
									she sought to change that. Sara understood the positive impact that
									having female connections, mentors, and role-models within the
									industry could have on her own career and knew that other women
									could benefit from making those connections as well. In 2019, WIN was
									organized to fill that need. Although WIN is a young organization, it
									seeks to host a variety of events and programming in the near future. As
									the organization grows, it hopes to expand its reach beyond the
									Indianapolis area.
								</p>
								<h2>About the Founder</h2>
								<p>
									Sara Omohundro founded WIN in January 2019. She currently serves as the 
									organizationâ€™s President. Sara is a Senior Investment Analyst covering private 
									markets. She has passed all three levels of the CFA exams. Sara graduated Magna 
									Cum Laude from Butler University in 2016 with a double major in Economics and 
									Finance and a double minor in Math and Philosophy. She has also published economic 
									research in the <i>Issues in Political Economy</i> journal.
